Article 
<p class="master">"Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer and the current captain of the India national team.
 A right-handed top-order batsman,
 Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. 
 After a few months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19.
 Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular 
 in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup.
 He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa.
 Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013,
 Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format,
 winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016)"
</p>
<p class="master2">
He continued his emphatic run in the World T20, batting (and running) like a man possessed,
 thrashing boundaries with ridiculous ease. Despite an 89* in the semi-final against the
 West Indies (extending his inhuman run of form in the format), India's bowling panicked at 
a crucial stage. One had to feel sorry for him as he had to make do with the 'Player of the 
tournament' award for the second successive Twenty20 World Cup; a distinction he would've 
gladly exchanged for the elusive World T20 trophy. Kohli's thirst for runs showed no signs
 of slowing down as he looted a small matter of 973 runs during the 2016 edition of the
 Indian Premier League, the most (by far) by any batsman in the history of the tournament - as 
he led his Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) franchise to a runners-up finish.
